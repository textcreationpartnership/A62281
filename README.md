1. THE Neceſsity of adhering TO The Church of ENGLAND as by Law eſtabliſhed, &c.

    _ The pretence of Conſcience and being ſatisfied in their way without aſſurance from the Scriptures is an unſafe foundation.

    _ Obedience to Governours and love and unity with our fellow Chriſtians, neceſſary Duties of the Goſpel.

    _ There muſt be a method and order obſerved in appointing the Biſhops and Governours of the Church, that Men may know whom they ought to obey, and whoſe puniſhments they ought to avoid.

    _ What method was obſerved in appointing Biſhops and Governours of the Church after the Apoſtles dayes.

    _ All Perſons in this Nation are bound to joyn in Communion with their Biſhop of the Dioceſs and Miniſter of the Pariſh where they live, and the great ſin of thoſe that neglect this Duty.

    _ Beſies the guilt of diſobedience and contempl of Chriſts Miniſters, you that aſſemble in Conventicles are guilty of Schiſm; which is a damning Sin, and a root of all confuſion.

    _ If none of theſe temporal evils follow upon Schiſm (which God grant they may not) yet Schiſm brings in Hereſie, Ignorance and Prophaneſs.

    _ If their Teachers do not Sin wilfully and lead them into Hereſie, yet they may miſlead them through ignorance and unskilfullneſs.

    _ Objections and Queſtions againſt Conformity anſwered.

    _ If ſome Men of better underſtanding by their diligence get to a knowledge of the principal parts of their Duty, yet the generality of People, Children and Servants, will be expoſed to all Ignorance, Errour and Profaneſs.
